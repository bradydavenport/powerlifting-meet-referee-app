# Powerlifting meet management suite - referees' app

### About

Powerlifitng meets - squatting, benching, and deadlifting - how complicated can they be? Well, for both lifters and managers of meets, its actually quite complicated.  A robust, comprehensive application to manage powerlifting meets - encompassing lifter registration, weight classes, meet day platform display, scoring, and more - will ensure your meet runs as smoothly as possible.

This specific mobile application is an accompaniment of the main software application.  As it is necessary for 3 referees to give the 'red light' or 'white light' for each lifter for each lift, it is necessary to have an efficient method of doing so in order for lifters, spectators, and and the meet manager to see the results of each lift and whether it was a good lift or bad lift.

Each of the 3 referees will log in to this application from their phone which will be connect to the main meet management software.  The simple-to-use user interface will allow each side judge to mark their designation of a white light or red light, and reasoning for a red light (depth infraction, not following commands, etc)

The head referee will also make their red or white light designation, as well as certify the 2/3 ruling of a good lift or a bad lift, which will be sent to the main meet management app in order to process the lifters attempt, score it, and queue the next lifter.

### References and Credit

As a powerlifter myself and co-owner of a strength and conditioning gym that hosts sanctioned powerlifting meets, I have used different meet management apps before.  Since learning how to code, I have looked at the previous software I have used through the lens of software development, and felt a yearn to make a product of my own to address points of friction I have encountered with others.  One such app I have used that I have drawn some inspiration from is [LiftingCast](https://liftingcast.com/).
